It is my course work about Kalman filtration. I have modeled positions of radar station, trajectory of the aircraft and location errors.
Then I have got a noisy trajectory(which the radar received). After that the resulting trajectory was filtred by first order Kalmal filter(alpha and beta filter).
The resulting standart deviations can be seen by you at the last picture. 
You can find more information about the work at .docx file.
